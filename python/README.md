##Python JapApps

###File Organization
The programs here are all programmed using Python. Each program has its own unique purpose for Japanese learning (e.g testing vocabulary, telling time or date, saying numbers, etc). The structure of these programs follow an OOP approach and thus use modules, located in the 'modules' directory, to effectively recycle/ reuse code when needed.

###How To Run
Install python first, preferably version 2.7.X, X={0,...,9}. Click the following link to download and install python in your OS. [https://www.python.org/download/](https://www.python.org/download/ "Download Python")

You can then run the .py files by either double clicking them or the much nerdy way of opening your command prompt, going to the directory where the .py files are located and running them by typing the 'filename'.py
