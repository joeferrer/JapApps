Install python first, preferably version 2.7.X, X={0,...,9}. Click the following link to download and install python in your OS. [https://www.python.org/download/](https://www.python.org/download/ "Download Python")

You can then run the .py files by either double clicking them or the much nerdy way of opening your command prompt, going to the directory where the .py files are located and running them by typing the 'filename'.py
