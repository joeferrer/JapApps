#JapApps#
<br/>
##About
JapApps is a passion-project/public repository for Japanese language learning applications inspired by and based on U.P. Diliman's (UPD) Hapon10 class under Sensei Weng Alvarez. JapApps is an ongoing project started by Joe Ferrer, a computer science major in UPD, to help reinforce lessons learned in school using programmed applications. 

##Development
Currently the applications in the JapApps project/repository are basic tests such as testing vocabulary, how to say the time/ date/ number. As of now, existing applications are programmed using Python but other applications may be made using other progamming languages/ tools/ frameworks. So far, only the creator, Joe Ferrer, is contributing to this project. Other contributors who are capable of teaching Japanese (_at any level_) and programming are most welcome!

__Note__: The organization of apps in this repository is by programming language/ tool/ framework used. If you wish to contribute, feel free to request to pull this repository or email me.

##Usage
For you to access the applications/ programs, you must first download the ZIP file of this repository or pull this repository from github. Then depending on the programming language/ tool/ framework used for the apps you wish to use, follow the instructions below accordingly. 

###Python Apps
Install python first, preferably version 2.7.X, X={0,...,9}. Click the following link to download and install python in your OS. [https://www.python.org/download/](https://www.python.org/download/ "Download Python")
<br>
<br>
You can then run the .py files by either double clicking them or the much nerdy way of opening your command prompt, going to the directory where the .py files are located and running them by typing the 'filename'.py
