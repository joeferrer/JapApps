#JapApps#
<br/>
##About
JapApps is a passion-project/public repository for Japanese language learning applications inspired by and based on U.P. Diliman's (UPD) Hapon10 class under Sensei Weng Alvarez. JapApps is an ongoing project started by Joe Ferrer, a computer science major in UPD, to help reinforce lessons learned in school using programmed applications. 

##Development
Currently the applications in the JapApps project/repository are basic tests such as testing vocabulary, how to say the time/date/number. Currently, applications are programmed using Python. So far, only the creator Joe Ferrer is contributing to this project. Other contributors who are capable of teaching Japanese and programming are most welcome!

##Usage
Install python first, preferably version 2.7.X, X={0,...,9}. Click the following link to download and install python in your OS. [https://www.python.org/download/](https://www.python.org/download/ "Download Python")
<br>
<br>
You can then run the .py files by either double clicking them or the much nerdy way of opening your command prompt, going to the directory where the .py files are located and running them by typing the 'filename'.py
