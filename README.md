##About
JapApps is a passion-project/public repository for Japanese language learning applications inspired by and based on U.P. Diliman's (UPD) Hapon10 class under Sensei Weng Alvarez. JapApps is an ongoing project started by Joe Ferrer, a computer science major in UPD, to help reinforce lessons learned in school using programmed applications. 

##Development
Currently the applications in the JapApps project/repository are basic tests such as testing vocabulary, how to say the time/ date/ number. As of now, existing applications are programmed using Python but other applications may be made using other progamming languages/ tools/ frameworks. The organization of apps in this repository is by programming language/ tool/ framework used. 
So far, only the creator, Joe Ferrer, is contributing to this project. Other contributors who are capable of teaching Japanese (_at any level_) and programming are most welcome! If you wish to contribute, feel free to request to pull this repository or email Joe Ferrer (_see creator's profile_)


##Usage
For you to access the applications/ programs, you must first download the ZIP file of this repository or pull this repository from github. Then depending on the programming language/ tool/ framework used for the apps you wish to use, follow the instructions in its corresponding folder accordingly.
